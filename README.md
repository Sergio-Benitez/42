# 🏫 42 Málaga - Projects & Experience  

Welcome to my repository containing all my projects from **42 Málaga**. Here you'll find exercises, projects, and challenges I've completed during my training. 🚀  

## 📂 Completed Projects  

### 🔹 **Libft**  
📝 A custom implementation of essential C library functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `malloc`, etc.), creating a personal library to be reused in future projects.  

### 🔹 **Born2beroot**  
🖥️ A system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine, configuring user privileges, and implementing security measures.  

### 🔹 **Ft_printf**  
🖨️ A recreation of the `printf()` function in C, supporting various format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.), precision handling, and buffer management.  

### 🔹 **Get Next Line**  
📜 A function that reads a file **line by line**, handling memory allocation efficiently and working with any file descriptor.  

### 🔹 **So_Long**  
🎮 A **2D game** developed using the **MiniLibX** graphics library. The player must navigate through a map, collecting items and reaching an exit while avoiding obstacles. This project introduces **event handling, textures, and game logic**.

### 🔹 **Pipex**  
🔀 A project focused on process creation and inter-process communication using **pipes** (`|`). It mimics the behavior of shell piping by executing two commands and redirecting their output efficiently.  

### 🔹 **Push_swap**  
♟️ An algorithmic challenge where a set of numbers must be sorted using only two stacks and a limited set of operations, requiring an optimized sorting strategy.  

### 🔹 **Philosophers**  
🍽️ A concurrency problem where multiple philosophers must alternate between eating and thinking without causing deadlocks or starvation, using **threads and mutexes**.
